# ACLF-JM

Here, you can find example testing data for the ACLF-JM application (https://predictionmodels.shinyapps.io/aclf-jm/).

You can use the column names and data properties as template for your own longitudinal data.
Instructions:
- In the ID column: assign a random ID number (e.g. 1).
- In the time_of_measurement column: set the day of measurement, e.g. if you followed a patient from day 0 (start measurements) to day 50 (current date). 
If your measurements are taken on a specific date, please visit the following link to calculate the date difference in days: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/calculate-the-difference-between-two-dates-8235e7c9-b430-44ca-9425-46100a162f38
